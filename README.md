# Objective

This is a simple app that take from the user a text file that contains data about multiple employees working on multiple projects in a specific format and detect the most two employees that have worked together for each project and show a table. On each row of the table you find the first employee ID, the second employee ID, the project ID, and the days of the two employees spent working together.

# How it works

open the HTML file in any modern browser like Chrome or Firefox and you will see an input field that requires a file to be uploaded. You can upload the text file you want from your local computer.
